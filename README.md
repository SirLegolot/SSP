# SSP
Here is a folder containing files from the Summer Science Program, where I tracked and predicted the orbit of a near-earth asteroid millions of years into the future.
This was used a while before I knew what git was, so I apologize for the very bad versioning history. I might revisit this sometime to organize the files.

# Minor Planet Center Findings
The two pdf documents in the root folder contain the asteroid findings of various observers. You can see the credits of discoveries for the group i worked with on the top right corner of page 371 in the MPS file.
